#Non-responsive Bootstrap
######disable the responsiveness in responsive layout by fixing the width of the container and using the first grid system tier

Reset the container's width to prevent collapsing.
###Browsers, scrolling, and fixed elements

Non-responsive layouts highlight a key drawback to fixed elements. Any fixed component, such as a fixed navbar, will not be scrollable when the viewport becomes narrower than the page content. In other words, given the non-responsive container width of 970px and a viewport of 800px, you'll potentially hide 170px of content.
